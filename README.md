#Sinatra-Shell
I need to know what a good base sinatra app looks like.  This repo is where I track that.

I plan to base all sinatra apps off it and push any worthy opinions about layout back into it in a  clean way.

1. `git clone git@github.com:pfarrell/sinatra-shell.git ${app_name}`
2. `bundle install`
3. `bower install`
4. `createdb app`
5. `bundle exec rackup`
6. [check the application](http://localhost:9292)
